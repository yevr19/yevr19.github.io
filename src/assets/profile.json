  "about": "Hi, my name is Eugene and my passion is programming. My journey began at the age of 14, when I became interested in IT.\n At that time, I thought about my future and firmly decided to associate my life with software development.\n At the beginning, I tried to learn the basics of software development on courses, but fortunately, I quickly realized that only self-discipline and hard work can help to achieve a result.\n Overtime, I was starting to help many people to get into Java development, improving my skills along the way. I have read many books, articles, and technical references.\n At the same time, I was doing various kinds of test tasks, committing to an Open Source project, and also met an amazing person who gave me the opportunity to create a potentially commercial product.\n If you've read this to the end, I'd like to add that my passion is to become a good engineer,constantly work and interact with people and be a good person :)",
