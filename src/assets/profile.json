  "about": "My name is Eugene, and I am a software developer with a passion for programming. My journey began at the age of 14 when I first discovered my interest in IT. It was at this point that I made the firm decision to dedicate my life to software development.\n\nAt the start, I attempted to learn the fundamentals of software development through courses. However, I quickly realized that self-discipline and hard work were the only ways to achieve my goals. Over time, I gained experience in Java development by helping others and taking on various tasks. I devoted time to reading books, articles, and technical references, while also contributing to open-source projects. During this time, I was fortunate enough to meet an amazing individual who provided me with the opportunity to create a commercial product.\n\nMy ultimate passion is to become an accomplished software engineer. I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills and working collaboratively with others to achieve success. I believe that being a good person is just as important as being a skilled engineer, and I strive to embody these qualities in all aspects of my work. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.",
